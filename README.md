## PyBank 

This script analyses the financial records of a company based on financial data provided in budget_data_csv (located in the Resources folder). This dataset includes columns for the Month and corresponding Profit and Loss. 

The following calculations are completed by the script:

  * The total number of months included in the dataset

  * The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  * Calculate the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, then find the average of those changes

  * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

The output is printed to the terminal and saved to a file named final_budget.txt.
